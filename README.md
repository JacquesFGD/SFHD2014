File description :  
The fasta file is an alignment of sequences of mTOR from 30 or so species (- stands for a gap in the alignment)  
formatter.py transforms this file in a dictionnary of sequences, accessible by an identifier.  
The function in it can turn a sequence in a list of numbers, based on the reference provided  
Aminoacids.csv links amino acids to the numbers (last column can be changed to any output you want)  
Idfile.csv links the sequence identifiers to the species they are coming from
